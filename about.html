      <p>
        I didn’t always know I wanted to be a designer. I started out exploring graphic design,
        photography, and videography—anything that let me create. But when my sister introduced me
        to UI/UX, something clicked. At first, I was drawn to the visuals, but I quickly fell in love
        with the problem-solving side of it—the challenge of making something both beautiful and
        meaningful.

        My process is intuitive and iterative; every choice I make has a reason behind it. I want my
        work to feel thoughtful, clear, and usable—the kind of design that makes sense to everyone.
        I’m constantly learning, growing, and pushing myself to get better. One day, I hope to work in
        a space that’s professional, forward-thinking, and driven by innovation.
